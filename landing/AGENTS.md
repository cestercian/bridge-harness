# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Landing site conventions

- Tailwind CSS v4 only, configured CSS-first in `app/globals.css` (`@theme`, `@layer base`). No `tailwind.config.js`, no CSS Modules, no CSS-in-JS, no inline `style` for anything a utility can express.
- Next.js has no Vite pipeline, so `@tailwindcss/postcss` in `postcss.config.mjs` is the only supported Tailwind v4 integration here. Keep that file to the single Tailwind plugin.
- The tokens in `app/globals.css` mirror the Graphite (dark) palette in `../src/index.css` value for value, using the same variable names. When the app palette changes, update this file in the same change so the mockup stays accurate.
- The hero runs the product as animated DOM, not a screenshot and not a video: `app/components/AppDemo.tsx` renders the real chrome (248px rail, toolbar, composer, changes dock) around one of the scenes in `app/content/appScenes.ts`, and plays each one on a tick clock: the prompt types, replies stream, tool rows spin and settle, checks run, the diff counts up, every Mission Control tile streams at once, and the active scene pill fills as it plays. Every class is lifted from the running app. To re-derive them, run `node node_modules/.bin/vite --port 1468` from the repo root, accept the model setup wizard, add the `dark` class to `html`, then read the rendered classes off a session. Update the scenes in the same change as any app redesign, or the hero becomes a lie.
- Scenes are data. Add or edit them in `app/content/appScenes.ts` rather than branching inside a component; the sidebar tree there is deliberately full (four checkouts, workers under their orchestrators, four harnesses at once) because an empty rail undersells the product. `lucide-react` is a dependency so the mock uses the app's own icons.
- Playback hands over when a scene finishes, so the whole strip plays through unattended. Hovering or focusing the demo holds the current scene and replays it. Server-rendered HTML holds the finished scene, so the page is complete without JavaScript, and `prefers-reduced-motion` skips playback rather than hiding anything.
- The loop section's mini mocks still render from `app/components/MockEntry.tsx` with entries typed in `app/content/scenes.ts`; keep those aligned with the app's entry styles.
- The docs section renders the repository's own markdown. `app/content/docs.ts` is a curated manifest, and `app/lib/renderDoc.ts` reads each file from `../docs` at build time and rewrites its relative links: a target in the manifest becomes an internal route, anything else becomes a GitHub blob link that opens in a new tab. Adding a doc means adding a manifest entry, not copying prose.
- Because the docs are read from `../docs`, the Vercel project must build with the whole repository available, not the `landing/` directory alone. If a deploy ever ships an empty docs section, that is the cause.
- `.doc-prose` in `app/globals.css` is a deliberate exception to utilities-first styling, for the same reason the app keeps a `.md` class: rendered markdown needs descendant selectors.
- Blog posts live in `app/content/blog.ts` as typed blocks. If someone wants to write long-form in markdown, MDX is the upgrade path; it was not worth the toolchain for prose this short.
- External links and the advertised release live in `app/content/site.ts`.
