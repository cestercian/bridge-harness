/*
 * The animated product demo. Every class in `components/app/*` is lifted from the running
 * app (sidebar widths, row heights, the ui/caption/message type scale), so this is the real
 * interface rendered as DOM rather than a picture of it. To re-derive the markup, run
 * `node node_modules/.bin/vite --port 1468` from the repo root, accept the model setup
 * wizard, add the `dark` class to <html>, and read the rendered classes off a session.
 *
 * Scenes are data. Each one lists the steps the player reveals in order; nothing here
 * branches inside a component.
