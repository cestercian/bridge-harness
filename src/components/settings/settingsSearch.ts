// The rail search: one query over every row on every page.
//
// Settings grew to nine pages, and "which page is the inline suggestion model
// on" stopped having an obvious answer. Rather than guess at an information
// architecture that makes every row findable by browsing, the rail searches the
// rows themselves and names the page each hit belongs to.
//
// The static index below covers the rows a page always has. Rows that only
// exist because of the user's data (a harness, a preset, a prompt section) are
// contributed at render time through `extraRows`, so a search for "opencode"
// finds the runtime as well as the word in a description.
