//! Briefing authority: what a model may touch while reading connected tools.
//!
//! This is deliberately not a rung on [`crate::delegation::WriteMode`]. A write
//! mode answers "how much of the filesystem may this agent change", and every
//! rung of it still assumes an agent doing work on a repository with a human
//! nearby. A briefing run is the opposite situation: nobody is watching, and the
//! text coming back from a connector is untrusted and may be asking for a shell.
//!
//! So authority here is deny-by-construction. Nothing is available until Bridge
//! supplies an exact reviewed tool identity, and the built-in families a coding
//! agent would normally want are refused by name as well, so a refusal can say
//! which liability it refused rather than only "not on the list".
//!
//! Every way this can fail to be safe resolves to [`BriefingUnsupported`], which
//! carries a reason. An unknown adapter, an uncertified provider version, a
//! permission representation nothing here recognizes, an ambiguous tool name — all
//! of them fail closed and say so. None of them is a silent `false`.
