//! The Cursor harness: finding the vendor's CLI, proving it speaks the
//! protocol, and running a session through the shared ACP client.
//!
//! **This is the first harness Bridge adopts without writing a provider
//! adapter.** Codex, Claude and OpenCode each needed a private wire format
//! learned by hand; Cursor ships an ACP server inside its own CLI, so
//! everything after the handshake — turns, streaming, permissions, cancel,
//! replay — is [`crate::acp_session`] and [`crate::acp_events`] unchanged. What
//! remains is Cursor-specific and is all that lives here: where the executable
//! is, whether it is really the one Bridge means, whether this build of it
//! speaks the protocol at all, and where a credential may and may not appear.
//!
//! **Two names, one executable, and only one of them is evidence.** The
//! installer puts `agent` on PATH; the published registry entry and the vendor's
//! own documentation use `cursor-agent`. The bare name is shared with an
//! unrelated vendor's CLI, so resolving it proves nothing on its own. Bridge
//! prefers `cursor-agent`, and when only `agent` is found it requires the
//! executable to identify itself as Cursor during the handshake before the
//! harness is offered. Discovery never installs, downloads, or modifies
//! anything: this is a vendor CLI the user chose to install, exactly like the
//! other three.
//!
//! **The protocol is confirmed, never assumed.** `acp` is a hidden subcommand —
//! it is absent from `--help`, so support cannot be established by reading help
//! output. Worse, a build that predates it does not reject it: it treats `acp`
//! as a prompt, starts an interactive terminal session, and paints control
//! sequences onto stdout while a client waits forever for a handshake. Reading
//! `--version` narrows the question and does not answer it, because the version
//! string is a bare date and hash with no name in it and no published cutover.
//! So the only sound test is the handshake itself, under a timeout, with
//! non-protocol output treated as a failed probe rather than as noise to skip
//! past. The shared client already separates the two: a stdout line that is not
//! shaped like a JSON message never reaches the parser and lands in the bounded
//! noise tail, which is what makes a terminal-painting build legible here
//! instead of merely silent.
//!
//! **A probe costs a process, so it is taken once per build.** The result is
//! cached against the path and version it was taken against. Reading adapter
//! availability is a hot path — the descriptor is rebuilt on every state read —
//! and re-probing there would spawn a child per keystroke. A version that moved
//! invalidates the cache, because the whole point of the probe is that support
//! is a property of the build.
//!
//! **Authentication stays the vendor's.** Bridge never reads, copies, or stores
//! Cursor's credentials, profile, or cookies: an existing login made with the
//! vendor's own command is used as it stands, and a session that needs one is
//! reported as needing sign-in with that command named. Where a key is
//! configured it is passed in the launched process environment and nowhere
//! else — never on the command line, where `--api-key` would put it in every
//! process listing on the machine, and never in a descriptor, an availability
//! reason, or a failure report.
//!
//! **Capabilities are read off the session.** Models and modes are whatever the
//! agent advertised when the session opened, and their identifiers are echoed
//! back byte for byte. That is not fastidiousness: Cursor's model identifiers
//! live in namespaces that differ per picker mode and match neither the
//! command-line spelling nor the display label, and sending a reconstructed one
//! fails *every* model with an invalid-params error that reads to a user like a
//! lapsed subscription. Bridge therefore never derives an identifier from a
//! label, and it never asks for the richer picker: opting into it means sending
//! a client `_meta` flag whose exact spelling is not published, and a guessed
//! key would silently select the wrong namespace. The default picker is what
//! the session reports and what Bridge offers.
