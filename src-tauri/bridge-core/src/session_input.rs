//! The active-turn input contract.
//!
//! A user typing into a working agent is supervision, not a race. Bridge has
//! exactly three answers, and this module owns the durable state and the pure
//! policy behind them:
//!
//! - nothing is running → start a normal turn;
//! - a chat's own turn is running → stop it and start a new turn with the
//!   text, on every provider ([`interrupts_active_turn`]);
//! - a worker's turn is running and the provider takes input natively → steer
//!   it;
//! - otherwise → queue the text durably and deliver it at the next phase
//!   boundary, exactly once.
//!
//! The queue is SQLite, not a field on a runtime struct, because a reconnect or
//! a daemon restart must not lose what the user typed — and a replayed drain
//! must not deliver it twice.
