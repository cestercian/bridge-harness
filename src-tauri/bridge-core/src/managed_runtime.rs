//! Official-source resolution for Bridge-managed agent runtimes.
//!
//! Bridge is not a distributor. Payload bytes always come from the vendor's own
//! source; what Bridge ships is the pinned version, the expected integrity where
//! the publisher provides one, and the resolution order below.
//!
//! # Two integrity models
//!
//! The three runtimes are not the same shape, and pretending otherwise would
//! mean claiming a guarantee one of them cannot give:
//!
//!   * A [`RuntimeSource::ReleaseArtifact`] is a single published file, so the
//!     recipe carries a publisher-pinned SHA-256 and a mismatch is fatal before
//!     anything is promoted.
//!   * A [`RuntimeSource::NpmClosure`] is a dependency *closure*. An `npm`
//!     install tree is not byte-reproducible across machines — the Claude SDK
//!     alone pulls platform-specific binaries — so there is no honest constant to
//!     pin it against. Its supply-chain guarantee comes from npm verifying every
//!     tarball against the per-package integrity in a committed lockfile, and the
//!     #174 tree digest is computed from the installed result. That digest still
//!     does what it was built for: proving ownership and catching later drift.
//!
//! # Resolution order
//!
//! Explicit user configuration, then a Bridge-managed receipt-bound payload, then
//! a copy bundled with the app, then the system PATH. A runtime found on PATH is
//! never claimed as Bridge-managed: it resolves as
//! [`RuntimeResolution::External`], stays usable, and is Bridge's to launch but
//! never to remove.
