//! Host shells keep only transport concerns: blocking-pool placement for Git
//! scans and worktree creation, and event emission after mutations. Methods
//! that surround a host-run blocking step are split into a `plan_*` /

//! host-run live-turn orchestration until that slice moves behind the core seam.
